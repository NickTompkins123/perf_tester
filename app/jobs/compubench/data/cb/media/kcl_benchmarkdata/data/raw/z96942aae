8. Governing Law and jurisdiction

This EULA (including without limitation all disputes arising from or in connection with this EULA, its breach, termination, validity or interpretation) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws in force in Hungary. Notwithstanding any provision in this EULA, KISHONTI or you may request any judicial, administrative, or other authority to order any provisional or conservatory measure, including injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief, prior to the institution of legal proceedings, or during the proceedings, for the preservation of its rights and interests or to enforce specific terms that are suitable for provisional remedies. The English version of this EULA will be the version used when interpreting or construing this EULA. This EULA will not be governed by the conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.


9. Miscellaneous provisions

(a) This EULA is the entire agreement between KISHONTI and You relating to the Software and it supersedes any prior representations, discussions, undertakings, communications, or advertising relating to the Software (except for the application of KISHONTI's Privacy Policy).

(b) If any provision of this EULA (including any section, clause, paragraph, sentence or word in it) is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of this EULA save that it shall be apparent from the nature or the contents of this EULA or the circumstances under which this EULA had been entered into that such provision may not be severed from the rest of the EULA. The same applies if there should be any errors or omissions in this EULA, which can be resolved within reason. In place of the legally unenforceable provisions, or to correct any errors or omissions, the parties shall negotiate and agree reasonably and in good faith and in accordance with the basic principles set forth in this EULA, on an appropriate substitute provision which, as far as legally possible, comes closest to what this EULA commercially intended, or would have intended, had they known of the legal unenforceability, error or omission (as the case may be). 
(c) This EULA will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer if such rights are mandatorily applicable to this EULA. 

(d) This EULA may only be modified by a writing signed by an authorized officer of KISHONTI. Updates may be licensed to You by KISHONTI with additional or different terms.
